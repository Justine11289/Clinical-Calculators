Engineered to streamline clinical diagnostic workflows, this platform integrates HL7 FHIR R4 standards and Taiwan Core Implementation Guide (TW Core IG) with a modular calculation engine to provide real-time clinical decision support (CDS). By leveraging SMART on FHIR protocols and OAuth 2.0, it automates patient data retrieval for over 92 standardized clinical calculators across 14 specialties, effectively eliminating manual entry errors and transcription risks.

## Project Overview
In contemporary medical practice, clinical risk assessment often relies on independent tools that require clinicians to manually extract and input values from Electronic Health Records (EHR). This process is not only administratively burdensome but also highly susceptible to transcription errors. Furthermore, inconsistent data formats across different medical institutions hinder the development of universal clinical tools.

This platform addresses these challenges by implementing a standardized FHIR-based architecture. By embedding calculators as apps within the hospital's EHR system, the system actively retrieves patient demographics, laboratory results, and vitals using the patient ID in context. This "Zero-Entry" experience ensures data integrity and allows healthcare providers to focus on clinical judgment rather than manual data processing.

### Key Features

* **Intelligent Auto-Fill (90%+ Automation):** Utilizes authorized FHIR R4 APIs to map clinical data. Empirical tests show the system can automatically complete over 90% of required data fields, minimizing human intervention.
* **Configuration-Driven Factory Model:** Implements a modular architecture where clinical logic (TypeScript-based) is decoupled from the UI, allowing for rapid scaling to 92+ tools while maintaining interface consistency.
* **TW Core IG Integration:** Fully adapted to the Taiwan Core Profiles, ensuring seamless data interoperability within the local medical ecosystem.
* **Multi-dimensional Decision Analysis:** Provides visual "Trade-off Analysis" reports for complex cases, assisting medical teams in making data-driven clinical decisions.
* **Advanced Safety & Verification:** Features a Data Staleness Check to ensure the validity of clinical parameters and adheres to Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) verification protocols.

## Technical Architecture

The system is designed with a three-tier architecture to ensure logic accuracy and data security:
1.  **Foundation Layer**: Manages FHIR OAuth2 authorization, data fetching, and unit conversions.
2.  **Factory Core**: Features the `UnifiedFormulaFactory` and `ScoringFactory` which parse clinical blueprints into executable logic.
3.  **Application Layer**: A responsive UI built with TypeScript and CSS variables, supporting Point-of-Care usage on mobile and desktop.
